# MapleStoryJobIDs
This repository houses a collection of MapleStory Job IDs up to Lara.  
**Corresponding Patch Versions:**
  - *KMS: v351*
    - **MapleStory LIVE** - introduction of Lara class
  - *GMS: v224* (Lara not available as of time of writing)
    - **MapleStory NEO: Light's Wrath** - equivalent to Hotel Arcs
  - *MSEA: v206* (Lara not available as of time of writing)
    - **MapleStory NEO: Hotel Arcs**

All efforts have been made to trace Job IDs in both GMS and KMS accurately. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/MapleStoryJobIDs/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/MapleStoryJobIDs/pulls) for mistakes.  
Notable ommissions:  
 - SAO Classes: *Kirito, Asuna, Leafa* (GMS)
 - Sengoku Class (Special): *Ayame*
 - Jett-equivalents: Zen/Mo Xuan

Job IDs are provided as YAML files; one maps Job IDs to their names, and the other vice versa.
