# MapleStoryJobIDs
This repository houses a collection of MapleStory Job IDs up to Kain.  
**MapleStory NEO:**
  - *KMS: v343*
  - *GMS: v214* (Kain not available as of time of writing)
  - *MSEA: v195* (Kain not available as of time of writing)

All efforts have been made to trace Job IDs in both GMS and KMS accurately. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/MapleStoryJobIDs/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/MapleStoryJobIDs/pulls) for mistakes.  
Notable ommissions (Plase contribute if you have their Job IDs):  
 - SAO Classes: *Kirito, Asuna, Leafa* (GMS)
 - Sengoku Class (Special): *Ayame*
 - Explorer Class (Special): *Zen* (MSEA/CMS/TMS) - Probably the same as Jett but need confirmation

Job IDs are provided as YAML files; one maps Job IDs to their names, and the other vice versa.
